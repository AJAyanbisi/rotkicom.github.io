# Introduction

rotki is the opensource portfolio tracker and accounting tool that protects your privacy. It started in 2017 as a small CLI tool to cater for my own portfolio tracking and tax reporting needs as a technical crypto user in Germany. Since then it has grown a lot and into its own project with thousands of users, 100 code contributors and a dedicated and passionate userbase. 

# Year in review

This post is a look back in the year that passed, recounting what we did at rotki since the start of 2022. We are gonna look at both what happened in the app and the code, but also how did the team itself grow and evolve. I (Lefteris), am writing here using the first person as this is my personal outlook on how rotki grew this year.

## January

We released two rotki patch releases. 1.23.1 and 1.23.2

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/v1_23_1.png' | relative_url}}" />
<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/v1_23_2.png' | relative_url}}" />

Also [Luki Centuri](https://github.com/lukicenturi), the frontend developer who had just joined us at the end of the previous year completed his first month. Our team was finally more than just 3 people!

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/luki.png' | relative_url}}" />

## February

In February we released another patch release, 1.23.3

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/v1_23_3.png' | relative_url}}" />

And our team [kept working](https://github.com/rotki/rotki/graphs/contributors?from=2022-02-01&to=2022-03-01&type=c) dilligently toward making 1.24.0.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/february_commits.png' | relative_url}}" />

## March

In March we released yet another patch release, 1.23.4, making 1.23.xx release series the longest patch release series of 2022.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/v1_23_4.png' | relative_url}}" />


Also we had our first non-tech hire! [Celina](https://twitter.com/celina_celka) joined our team.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/celina.png' | relative_url}}" />

Celina has handled all non-developer related tasks such as HR, accounting, all organizational matters and even a bit of communications!


## April

April was a really interesting month as we had two new hires who were onboarded to the backend team.

The first was [Isaac](https://github.com/prettyirrelevant).

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/isaac.png' | relative_url}}" />

Isaac is a developer from Nigeria who joined the backend team and has so far helped us with various issues on the backend.

The second was [Alexey](https://github.com/nebolax).

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/alexey.png' | relative_url}}" />

Alexey was our youngest hire, an enthusiastic 18yo developer from Russia who has since helped us with various rotki backend matters.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/april_commits.png' | relative_url}}" />

And the team kept on grinding towards the long awaited 1.24.0 release while at the same time trying to onboard the new hires.

## May

At the end of May we finally managed to release v1.24.0.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/v1_24_0.png' | relative_url}}" />

That was the biggest release we have ever made (and I hope to not do it again) and contained among others:

- The start of the ethereum transactions decoding
- Kraken staking
- Support for ftx.us
- ens reverse resolution
- ability to manipulate balance snapshots
- uniswap price oracle

## June

In June we released a quick patch release to fix bugs found in 1.24.0

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/v1_24_1.png' | relative_url}}" />

And we also kept grinding and coding towards 1.25.0 and trying to learn how to work as a bigger backend team now that we have had Isaac and Alexey.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/june_commits.png' | relative_url}}" />

## July

July was quite a busy month!

### EthBarcelona

It started with a trip to Barcelona for [EthBarcelona](https://ethbarcelona.com/) where we [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhYiOWrFKVs) about rotki and the benefits of opensource software.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/ethbarcelona-persentation.jpg' | relative_url}}" />

It was a very moving moment for me as it was the first time I met with [Yabir](https://github.com/yabirgb) in real life.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/ethbarcelona-yabir.jpg' | relative_url}}" />

We have been working with Yabir since 2021 and getting to see him in the flesh after one and a half year was amazing.

What's more we got to meet Viktor (left)!

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/ethbarcelona-viktor.jpg' | relative_url}}" />

[Viktor](https://github.com/vnavascues) used to work with rotki for a few months from the end of 2020 until Q2 2021! He is a native of Barcelona and after rotki, he stayed in the crypto field so it was really cool to meet him too in real life!

### v1.25.0

After Barcelona we released v1.25.0.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/v1_25_0.png' | relative_url}}" />

It was a French-themed release as we were also heading to Paris for EthCC.

Among others it contained support for:

- Bitcoin cash
- LiFo accounting
- Management of multiple ethereum nodes
- Mac M1 support
- Ethereum address book
- Filtering of ethereum transactions
- Zoom in charts

### EthCC

In July we also travelled to Paris for [EthCC](https://ethcc.io/) where we [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY5o3W4hSBM&list=PLhM7rBgpVV-JnmRLUbd10ELntN3LFfmKH&index=17) about rotki's progress and how opensource is a core of what we do.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/ethcc-presentation.jpg' | relative_url}}" />

EthCC is a very important conference for us as it is in [EthCC 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIT0L9GDYEg) that I first presented about rotki to an audience.

Both [Yabir](https://github.com/yabirgb) and [Kelsos](https://github.com/kelsos) travelled to Paris for EthCC so this was the first time those two managed to meet in person.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/ethcc-all3.jpg' | relative_url}}" />

Another really cool meeting in EthCC was meeting with the first user in the wild, [jimjim.eth](https://twitter.com/jimjim_eth), who used the rotki dappnode package at his home and connected and used it from his mobile phone! rotki mobile was already a reality!

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/ethcc-jimjim.jpg' | relative_url}}" />

### v1.25.1

We closed this very busy month with a patch release, 1.25.1, that fixed bugs our users saw with 1.25.0.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/v1_25_1.png' | relative_url}}" />

Fun fact is that this release was implemented while we were trying to figure out our hotels and flights. That trip to Paris was cursed. Both flights to/from Paris were delayed/canceled and our hotels/airbnbs all presented problems :D

## August

In August, recovering from the busy month of July, we released 1.25.2 that fixed yet more issues and added improvements on top of 1.25.1.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/v1_25_2.png' | relative_url}}" />

What's more the team kept working dilligently towards our next big milestone, 1.26.0.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/august_commits.png' | relative_url}}" />

## September

September was also a busy month! Most of the team travelled to Berlin, for the Berlin blokchain week.

### Dappcon

We [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJrpKyyl4) at [dappcon](https://www.dappcon.io/) about rotki and what its strengths are but also what the challenges with making an opensource application are, especially related to funding.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/dappcon-presentation1.jpg' | relative_url}}" />
<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/dappcon-presentation2.jpg' | relative_url}}" />

Dappcon was an amazing experience for us as it was the very first time the biggest part of the team was in the same place. We met Alexey in real life for the first time after working together for almost 5 months!

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/dappcon-all.jpg' | relative_url}}" />

From left to right: [Kelsos](https://github.com/kelsos), [Yabir](https://github.com/yabirgb), [Lefteris](https://github.com/LefterisJP), [Celina](https://github.com/celkacelka), [Alexey](https://github.com/nebolax).


### EthBerlin

We also participated in [ETHBerlin 3](https://ethberlin.ooo/)!

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/ethberlin1.jpg' | relative_url}}" />

We hacked on various rotki related things and had some workshops.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/ethberlin3.jpg' | relative_url}}" />

Also took this chance to enjoy team lunches together, including with Celina :)

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/ethberlin2.jpg' | relative_url}}" />

Finally we bonded together through the entire event and even met external rotki contributors, like Pablo pictured here on the left.

### v1.25.3

In September we also released rotki v1.25.3, a bugfix release that was building on top of 1.25.2 adding lots of improvements but also fixing bugs our users found.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/v1_25_3.png' | relative_url}}" />

## October

October was also a very busy month. Including a major release and the trip to Bogota, for Devcon.

### Bogota - EthBogota

Kelsos, Alexey and I flew to Bogota, Colombia to participate in a few events there. First was the EthBogota hackathon

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/ethbogota1.jpg' | relative_url}}" />
<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/ethbogota2.jpg' | relative_url}}" />

There we met many like-minded hackers, hacked on rotki related issues and tried to get more people involved with rotki. Hackathons are a great place to find new contributors and to shill an opensource project.

### Bogota - Schelling point

After that there was an one day event called [schelling point](https://schellingpoint.gitcoin.co/), where I participated in a [panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_JMDUo09Z0&list=PLvTrX8LNPbPkQ3qDNpQDRZQClhUl_BJQp&index=14)

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/schellingpoint1.jpg' | relative_url}}" />
<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/schellingpoint2.jpg' | relative_url}}" />

There we discussed about how opensource is a public good, what the challenges are but also what are the benefits. As usual the problem of sustainably funding opensource came up.

### Bogota - Devcon

And finally we had our first ethereum devcon in 3 years. It was a very long time since Japan when the last devcon happened.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/devcon1.jpg' | relative_url}}" />
<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/devcon2.jpg' | relative_url}}" />

There I (Lefteris) [presented](https://archive.devcon.org/archive/watch/6/understanding-transactions-in-evm-compatible-blockchains-powered-by-opensource/?playlist=Developer%20Infrastructure&tab=YouTube) about the modular opensource transaction decoding system we have in rotki and how this can be generalized and used by other applications.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/devcon-lef-presentation.jpg' | relative_url}}" />

Kelsos also presented about rotki in general, its architecture,  our progress and about how opensource is core to what we do.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/devcon-kelsos-presentation.jpg' | relative_url}}" />

All in all it was an amazing experience. We met many like-minded people, many rotki users and external contributors and got re-affirmation that what we are building is useful. What's more we got lots of feedback on things that could improve and have adjusted our future planning accordingly.

### Bogota - Team building

Since we were on the other side of the world and we are a remote team, we took this chance to do some team building events. Mostly hikes and sightseeing so we can experience a different location together and create team bonds that will hopefully last for long. In the pictures below first is [Lake Guatavita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Guatavita) where the legend of El Dorado comes from and second is [La Chorrera](http://ropewiki.com/Chorrera_(Colombia)), the tallest watterfal in Colombia.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/bogota-team2.jpg' | relative_url}}" />

### v1.26.0

Right after coming back from Colombia, we released our latest major release for which we have been working since August, 1.26.0.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/v1_26_0.png' | relative_url}}" />

This included among others:

- Internationalization
- Bitcoin taproot support
- Note taking
- Convex finance support
- Multi-chain assets
- Custom assets and custom prices
- LP balances in the dashboard

## November

November was a hands down and working month. The team was working on 3 things.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/november_commits.png' | relative_url}}" />

- Website Infrastructure
- Bug fixes
- Next major release


And we also released 1.26.1, a release that fixed bugs seen since 1.26.0.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/v1_26_1.png' | relative_url}}" />

## December

And finally we come to the last month of the year that has not even ended yet.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/december_commits.png' | relative_url}}" />

The team had a lot of deserved time off for the holidays but also worked hard on putting out minor improvements and bug fixes while also working on the upcoming v1.27.0 release.

In December we released two patch releases.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/v1_26_2.png' | relative_url}}" />

1.26.2 which among many other things replaced the default open ethereum nodes with modern ones which are faster and as such provided a big performance improvement for our ethereum users.

<img class="post_image_not_set_size with_border" src="{{'/public/post12/v1_26_3.png' | relative_url}}" />

1.26.3 which fixed a lot of bugs our users saw and also provided minor improvements in the user experience.

In general the team is laser focused, as we go in the new year to release 1.27.0 which will, among other things, bring full Optimism support

# Closing

Looking back at 2022 we did a lot more than I expected we would. Achieved so much but also spent time growing. I think, it's the year rotki "grew up". Growing from 3 devs to 6 devs and 1 non-technical person is not a small feat! Neither was it easy. I hope we can continue to build rotki into the tool that you guys want and have a lot of happy users and contributors. Here is to a more productive, more succesful and happier new year 2023!

That's all!
